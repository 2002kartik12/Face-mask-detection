# face-mask-detection

The objective of the project is to develop a model which can be used to detect face masks in a group of people to prevent Covid-19. In the middle of Covid-19 crisis, wearing masks is a fundamental need nowadays. In public places because of the large volume of people it becomes tough for security officials to check every person who is not wearing a mask. This model detects a single person wearing a mask or not. The model is implemented using a webcam where the video is read by frame and resized as necessary. This project helps in identifying people who are not wearing a face mask.
